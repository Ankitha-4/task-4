*On Windows Firewall:
Open Windows Defender Firewall → Advanced Settings.

Navigate to Inbound Rules → Click New Rule.

Select Port, choose TCP, and enter 23.

Select “Block the connection”, apply to all profiles.

Name the rule (e.g., “Block Telnet”) and finish.

Test using telnet 127.0.0.1 23 → Connection should fail.

To restore settings, delete the rule from Inbound Rules.

*How Firewalls Filter Traffic:
1. Rule-Based Filtering
Firewalls use rules that define which traffic is allowed or blocked.

Rules are based on:

IP address (source/destination)

Port number (e.g., 80 for HTTP, 22 for SSH)

Protocol (TCP, UDP, ICMP)

Direction (inbound or outbound)

2. Packet Inspection
Firewalls examine headers and payloads of data packets.

Simple firewalls perform stateless filtering (checks each packet independently).

Advanced firewalls use stateful inspection to track ongoing connections.

3. Traffic Direction
Inbound rules control traffic coming into the system.

Outbound rules control traffic leaving the system.

4. Default Policy (Implicit Rules)
Most firewalls have a default deny or default allow policy.

Example: Block all inbound traffic unless explicitly allowed.

5. Logging and Alerts
Firewalls can log dropped or allowed traffic.

Helps with auditing and detecting suspicious activities.
